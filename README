===================
  AdManager
===================

This is a simple Scala application.

===================
 Installation
===================

1. You install this application by deploying the file: 

  /bin/AdManager.jar 

to some app server. 

2. You can configure what Ads (banners) the app will hold by configuring the file:

  /WEB-INF/classes/ids_and_uris.txt 

In the basic configuration there are only 2 ads present (7 and 20899):

  7#Det goda fÃ¶retaget#http://www.programmera.net/img/Good.jpg#http://www.google.com
  20899#Gamla Sun#http://www.programmera.net/img/Coffee_Time.jpg#http://www.sun.com

  
===================
 Usage
===================

Let's say you deploy the JAR with the application name "a" at localhost port 80.

-----------------
 Transaction
-----------------
This app is called like this:

  http://localhost/a/7.iframe

This is called an "impression event", which means you will see a web page that displays the ad with id = 7.  If you click the image this URI will be called:

  http://localhost/a/7.click

At the same time a new window will be opended displaying this URL: 
  
  http://www.google.com

This is called a "click event".

-----------------
 Repository
-----------------
To view the repository, call this url:

  http://localhost/a/0.log

This might display some content like this:

Impressions
ImpressionEvent(7,b846b421f73607e4005832efcea8,Fri Aug 13 17:27:45 CEST 2010)

Clicks
ClickEvent(20899,b846b421f73607e4005832efcea8,Fri Aug 13 17:23:14 CEST 2010)
ClickEvent(7,b846b421f73607e4005832efcea8,Fri Aug 13 17:24:03 CEST 2010)

Read the data like this:

* The first number is the Ad ID.
* The second number is the SESSION ID of the surfer.
* The third text is the date and time of the event.


===================
  Build the code 
===================

You need the following to build:

* Scala 2.7.7 (To be able to run SBT)
* SBT

The code is depending on Scala 2.8.0, but this version will be downloaded by SBT during build.

When you have sbt installed, just go to the root directory of this project and type:

  bash$ sbt

  sbt> compile

  sbt> package

Now you can find the packed WAR-file in this dir:

  ./target/scala_2.8.0/admanager_2.8.0-1.0.war
